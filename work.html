        <h3>Open positions</h3>

        <p><b>Core developer</b>. <span style="font-size: 9px">Our core services are in Lisp. We will probably move to the JVM next month, and are looking for someone with a functional programming background who is equally comfortable working in various versions of blub. Ideally you will be capable of managing other software engineers, but if not we are okay with that.</span></p>

        <p><b>Android developer</b>. <span style="font-size: 9px">We have a prototype iOS app and are very excited to build an Android version also. You should ideally have a lot of ambition, willing to put in extra time and work for your own equity stake, and have a life beyond mobile devices. Tell us about it.</span></p>

        <p><b>Cryptologist</b>. <span style="font-size: 9px">We are dealing with security all day and all night. We need someone with a background in theoretical math / cryptography who can help design really cool solutions worthy of the 21st century.</span></p>

<p>Evergreen provides a digital currency supported by real assets. It is an alternative to
existing currencies in that it is globally accessible, provides a stable store of value, and
supports the global ecosystem. It will be the default currency of the rapidly growing
collaborative consumption and crowd funding communities.</p>
